IMPORTANT INFO:
On Windows and macOS systems the users are allowed to communicate over serial ports. 
But on Linux systems the users are not allowed to communicate over serial ports by default (this is for security reasons in Linux). So to allow the current user to communicate over Serial Ports, we need to follow these steps just one time. After following these steps the user can then communicate over serial ports. After following these steps one time, the user does not need to do anything else to access the serial ports.

1. Open Terminal and type:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

2. Log out and Log in again. 

3. If the problem still remains after step 1 and 2, then restart computer.
